# mioreanimations


The python file is my initial miore pattern animation expiriment. 

Visi is a more evolved project done in C# using the Monogame framework. So far the controls are as follows:

"1" and "2" toggle which pattern you are controlling, "1" is the grid and "2" is the nested ovals. 

You can rotate patterns clockwise by tapping "l" or counter clockwise with "j", the more you press these buttons the faster
the patterns rotate. 

"i" zooms in and "j" zooms out on a pattern.

"c" changes the color randomly.

"3" pulls up a simulation of flocking birds. I will probably split these into two projects soon.
